# Movie-Recommendation-System-Using-Collaborative-Filtering

First what's Collaborative Filtering?
 This filtering method is based on collecting and analysing information on User's behaviour, their activities, and preferences and predicting what they will like based on similarity with other users
 A Key Advantage of Collaborative approach is that we do not have to explicitly tell features about the items
 
 In Summary, Collaborative Filtering automatically recommends item to users based on the preferences of other users with similar interests
 
 For Example, If a person **A** likes item 1, 2, and 3 and a person B likes item 2, 3, and 4, they have similar interests in item 2 and 3 and thus A should like A should like item 4 and B should like item 1
